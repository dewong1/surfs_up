Performing analysis on Oahu's (Hawaii) precipitation levels to determine if its shop business is sustainable year-round


## Overview of Project

W. Amy is concerned about the amount of precipation on Oahu. There needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that you lose out on the ideal surfing and ice crean weather. With the last 12 months of precipitation data loaded into the SQLite database, we analyze the weather data to determine if Oahu is the perfect place to surf. For this analysis, we are using the tools-- *SQLite*, *SQLAlchemy*, and *Flask* to build on knowledge of SQL database structures and querying methods. The purpose of this project was to provide (in addition with our original weather analysis), more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


## Results
